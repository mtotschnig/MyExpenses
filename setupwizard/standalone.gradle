/**
 * Include this gradle file if you are building against this as a standalone gradle library project,
 * as opposed to building it as part of the git-tree. This is typically the file you want to include
 * if you create a new project in Android Studio.
 *
 * For example, you can include the following in your settings.gradle file:
 *      include ':setup-wizard-lib'
 *      project(':setup-wizard-lib').projectDir = new File(PATH_TO_THIS_DIRECTORY)
 *      project(':setup-wizard-lib').buildFileName = 'standalone.gradle'
 *
 * And then you can include the :setup-wizard-lib project as one of your dependencies
 *      dependencies {
 *          compile project(path: ':setup-wizard-lib', configuration: 'gingerbreadCompatRelease')
 *      }
